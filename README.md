# UFOs

# Overview of Project: 

#### Dana envisioned developing a webpage that provides information on UFO sightings to the public. We made her vision a reality using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. With these tools, we built the webpage's layout, added style, and imported the data on UFO sightings. We realized there was a lot of data, so we created a filter for visitors to search sightings by date. Now we would like to add more filters to narrow down the results.

# Results:

#### Image Above: When someone visits the webpage, they will first see the header, the page summary, and then the sightings. On the left-hand side of the sightings list is the Filter Search tool.

#### Image Above: As shown above, the Filter Search tool has five filters, each with instructions on what to enter and an example of how to enter the information.

#### Image Above: After entering information in a filter and pressing ente, the UFO sightings list will display results that match the filter(s).

#### Image Above: The more filters are entered, the more narrow the results. Therefore it is recommended to use less filters for more results.

# Summary: 

#### One drawback is that the search tool is case-sensitive. Although most people will eventually figure out that letters need to be lowercase, the fact is it leads to no results when attempted. We should check if there is a way to accept the text as long as it's spelled correctly. Another drawback of this new design is the inability to sort the columns. Currently, the sightings are only available in ascending order by date, but some people might prefer to sort the sightings by city, state, country, shape, or duration. We can make the webpage more user-friendly by allowing them to sort the sightings.
